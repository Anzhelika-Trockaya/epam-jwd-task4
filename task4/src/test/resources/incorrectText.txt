    I just returned* from the greatest summer vacation! It was so fantastic. I never wanted it to end. I spent eight days in Paris, France. We had a beautiful hotel, and it wasn’t even expensive. We had a balcony with a wonderful view.
    We visited many famous tourist places. My favorite was the Louvre, a well-known museum. The museum is so huge, you could spend weeks there.
    We took lots of breaks and sat in cafes. The French food we ate was delicious. The wines were tasty, too. Steve’s favorite part of the vacation was the hotel breakfast. We had so much fun that we’re already talking about our next vacation!
    End.
