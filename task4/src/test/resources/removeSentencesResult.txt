    I just returned from the greatest summer vacation! We had a beautiful hotel, and it wasn’t even expensive. We had a balcony with a wonderful view.
    My favorite was the Louvre, a well-known museum. The museum is so huge, you could spend weeks there.
    We took lots of breaks and sat in cafes. Steve’s favorite part of the vacation was the hotel breakfast. We had so much fun that we’re already talking about our next vacation!
